# Recursion - C Programming

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum. It focuses on using **recursion** in C to solve problems without using loops or standard library functions like `printf` or `strlen`.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. Each recursive call should bring the solution closer to a base case, which stops the recursion.

### When to Use Recursion
- When the problem has a naturally recursive structure (e.g. factorial, tree traversal).
- When the solution can be
