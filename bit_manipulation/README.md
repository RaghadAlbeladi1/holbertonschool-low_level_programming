# C - Bit Manipulation ![C Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C-blue.svg)

This project is part of the **Low-level programming** track at Holberton School.  
It focuses on understanding how to manipulate bits using bitwise operators in C.

| Task No. | File Name             | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `0-binary_to_uint.c`  | Converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.                           |
| 1        | `1-print_binary.c`    | Prints the binary representation of a number without using arrays, %, or /.|
| 2        | `2-get_bit.c`         | Returns the value of a bit at a specific index.                            |
| 3        | `3-set_bit.c`         | Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a specific index.                          |
| 4        | `4-clear_bit.c`       | Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a specific index.                          |
| 5        | `5-flip_bits.c`       | Returns the number of bits to flip to convert one number to another.       |
