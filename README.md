This project introduces the core concepts of the C programming language in a simple and practical way. It explains why C is a powerful and foundational language, who created it, and the key figures who influenced its growth—such as Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds. You’ll learn what happens when you compile a file using `gcc main.c`, understand the role of the `main` function as the entry point of any C program, and how to print output using functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`. The summary also covers how to use the `sizeof` operator to find memory sizes, how compilation works using `gcc`, what the default output file name is, and how to follow the official C coding style using the Betty linter. Finally, it touches on how to find the correct header files for standard library functions and how the return value from `main` can indicate the success or failure of the program.
