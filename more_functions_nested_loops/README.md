# More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program.  
It builds upon previous C projects by introducing more complex uses of functions, variable scope, nested loops, and strict compilation requirements.

- What is a **prototype**
- The **scope of variables**
- What the **gcc flags** mean:
  - `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, `-pedantic`, `-std=gnu89`
